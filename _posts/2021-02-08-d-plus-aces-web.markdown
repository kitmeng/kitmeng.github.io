<h3>BMW - A unified design system for a truly global brand.</h3>

<p>Designing the content platform for the future of driving pleasure. At the forefront of mobile technology and innovation, OPPO’s products enhance the lives of over 300 million people worldwide. Oppo.com is OPPO’s most important platform for online brand image communication, and it’s most important digital marketing channel. However, due to the reliance on a banner-based structure, the site faced several challenges, including difficulty scaling across devices, and a lack of visual consistency across markets.</p>

<p>In a world overcrowded with information, how do we design a progressive and innovative content platform of the future? With the redesign of oppo.com, the approach was to build a new design framework that introduced more breathing room around the content. This became our ‘ownable space,’ where we could bring to life OPPO’s unique design aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>The art direction was inspired by how BMW’s vision of Future Driving Pleasure connects the dots of innovation towards a progressive future. In every design element, transition and animation, we seeked to strike a balance between guided focus and inducing curiosity. Custom made content helped engage the audience and made the experience more immersive. We took inspiration from familiar user experience patterns (Tik Tok’s personalised content Feed) to intuitively recommend and seamlessly present relevant content to keep our audience engaged.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>The result is a bold and progressive, yet understated new design. We use a simple, spacious and clean layout system as our foundation. Through dynamic blocks of color, the prominent use of vibrant lifestyle photography, and moments of playful disruption, we inject authenticity, personality and creativity into the design.</p>

<h2>Color</h2>
<p>Dynamic colors are selected to match specific content, helping to create visual harmony and an immersive experience for the user. These key aspects of the design give users a better sense of OPPO as a brand: that its aesthetic is clean and timeless, but also creative and surprising.</p>
