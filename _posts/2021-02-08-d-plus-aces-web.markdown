<h3>Designing the content platform for the future of driving pleasure</h3>

<p>In a world overcrowded with information, how do we design a progressive and innovative content platform of the future?</p>

<p>The art direction was inspired by how BMW’s vision of Future Driving Pleasure connects the dots of innovation towards a progressive future.</p>

<p>In every design element, transition and animation, we seeked to strike a balance between guided focus and inducing curiosity. Custom made content helped engage the audience and made the experience more immersive.</p>

<p>We took inspiration from familiar user experience patterns (Tik Tok’s personalised content Feed) to intuitively recommend and seamlessly present relevant content to keep our audience engaged.</p>

<p>The result? The content platform of the future.</p>
