`Social` `Concept`

<h3>With internet speeds so fast, loading bars are out of a job.</h3>

<p>We projected a reality where loading bars have moved on to bigger and brighter things - because internet speeds are too fast.</p>

<p>On social, we created animations of loading bars working at their new jobs, e.g. a beach ball, an alarm clock, a straw.</p>
