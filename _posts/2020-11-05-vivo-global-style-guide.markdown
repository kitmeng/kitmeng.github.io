`Branding`

<h3>A unified brand identity for a truly global brand</h3>

<p>vivo.com is vivoâ€™s most important platform for online brand image communication and its most important digital marketing channel. However, the site faced several key challenges, most important being a lack of "vivo-ownable" web Brand Identity guidelines.</p>

<p>With the redesign of vivo.com upcoming, our role was to define guidelines for all the web visual materials. From Product, Humans, and Places Presentation, all the way to Writing Guidelines, we created the framework for how to bring vivo's unique world to life in a tangible way.</p>
