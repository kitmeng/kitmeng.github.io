`Web` `Concept`

<h3>Communicating MMC's features and innovations in a simple, predictive and human way.</h3>
<p>‘Mercedes me Connect’ is an array of services and innovations that provide added value based on the needs and lifestyle of Mercedes-Benz car owners.
</p>

<p>In China, as Mercedes-Benz cars are still viewed as "status cars", most car owners do not have a complete understanding of how MMC can unlock the full potential of their car and help them in relatable daily life situations.
</p>

<p>‘The Mercedes me Connect Library’ is an intelligent content system that predicts user’s interests, then showcases relevant content in a human way.</p>
