<h3>A V-Class Travelogue experience, featuring Roger Federer.</h3>

<p>We were tasked to create interesting, relevant and sharable social content for V-Class, in conjunction with Roger Federer's participation at the 2019 Shanghai ATP Masters.</p>

<p>We came up with the concept of "Roger Federer's 2019 Shanghai Travelogue" in order to highlight V-Class features in an organic way. Within the short span of 10 hours, we captured Roger Federer's unique perspective of immersive Shanghai's rich culture.</p>

<p>Shot through a first person's perspective, we aimed to capture Roger's amazing reactions to his unique Shanghai experience, and also to show viewers a personal view towards V-Class' spaciousness.</p>
